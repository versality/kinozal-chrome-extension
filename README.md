# Kinozal.tv Chrome Extension

_an open source chrome extension that helps to monitor new movie releases_

## Description

Extension visits pre-sorted, descending by seeds page.<br>
As soon as new movie entry appears in the list, unseen movies counter will increase.

## Contribution

I am not planning to add any other trackers yet.

However, modular design allows to add other trackers without too much hassle.<br>
Refer to ```trackers``` folder.
